Hints with using CVS with AgDRIFT development

cvs get agdrift
(edit existing source, add new form)
cvs add -m"New drop form" drop.frm
cvs add -kb -m"New drop form resources" drop.frx     <- binary
cvs commit -m"Changes for version 1.0"
cvs release agdrift
cvs rtag release-1_00 agdrift


WinCVS and AgDRIFT

How do I set up WinCVS for AgDRIFT?:
-Cvs Admin->Preferences
 General tab (others tabs retain default values):
 CVSROOT: tom@nomad.continuum-dynamics.com:/usr1/cvsroot
 Authentication: ".rhosts" file on the cvs server

Okay, I've finished the latest version and I'm ready to store it
in the repository:
-Start WinCVS
-Browse and select agdrift folder
-If there are new files to be added (question mark icon),
 select them, right click, Add Selection. Same for missing files;
 possibly Remove Selection, and unknown files; possibly Add Selection.
 Do this for all subfolders.
-Cvs Folders->Commit Folder (sends chages to repository) Do this for the
 top-level agdrift folder and let it recurse.
-Cvs Folders->Update Folder (updates WinCVS Icons) Do this for the
 top-level agdrift folder and let it recurse.
-Cvs Admin->Tag Module->Create a tag...
 New tag name:  "release-1_10" or similar
 Module to tag: "agdrift" The module name

I want to see all the revisions that are in the repository:
"cvs history -a -T -n agdrift", no quotes, type in the command window.
