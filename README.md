# pyAgDisp
Porting of Agdisp source code 8.29 to Python

The most recent folder upload contains code that matches AgDISP, as confirm by comparing trajector results for 2 fixed wing airplanes, multiple droplet sizes, and multiple boom locations. 

Helicopter and ground boom code is not yet included.

Evaporation is not yet included.

Output results array are not yet implemented.

Currently working on developing user input data sctructures and organizing code flow to match that of AgDISP.

Also working to document code inline where previous development efforts did not do so.
